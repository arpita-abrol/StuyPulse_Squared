Obstacles Overcome (and how!)
- There were problems with pushing files to GitHub and merging files, and files were deleted. 
--- Solution: we both had backup files in case it happens again.
--- Solution: we took advantage of Github's automatic backups and got our files from there
- For a while things were going slowly since the CSV files were taking a while to be prepared and they were needed to test the methods in order to proceed.
--- We used temperary numbers and methods to test existing methods and changed the methods to match the new CSV files later.
- There was a problem with a corrupted file of a sort. After committing and pushing it to Github, some odd lines were added in (about 6 different ones) and the file could no longer be compilied (even after those lines were moved- invisible characters?).
--- Took advantage of Github automatic backups, and retrieved the file from a previous version (couldn't revert back - error committing files with this issue).
- Figuring out what we want to do (class hierarchy and methods needed)
--- We looked at other sources for inspiration, such as YoRPG and the Pokemon Games (specifically, Pokemon Red/Blue/Yellow for GameBoy).


Unresolved Issues
- We might not be able to do everything we wanted since there isn't enough time.
- allowing certain functions to be called anywhere in the Driver file--do we want that? And how would we apply it?
- dealing with evolving via stones (how to distribute stones? randomly? prizes?)


Cool Stuff Learned (conceptual and/or practical)
- How to use CSV files in Java--reading, parsing, etc.


Mid-development Design Changes (and why!)
- Might have to decrease the maps/gym leaders/ quests
--- We don't have as much time as we would like to implement everything


Lessons Learned (...which you might apply to future projects, CS or otherwise)
- Time Management is KEY
- Cloud Storage (like Dropbox) is very helpful. Backup your files frequently, even if you don't commit (also: commit often!). 
- Always communicate with your partner to make sure when needs to be done and confirm if there are any changes in existing files.
- Murphey's Law...
