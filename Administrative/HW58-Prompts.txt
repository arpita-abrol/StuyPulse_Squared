Obstacles Overcome (and how!)
-There were problems with pushing files to GitHub and merging files, and files were deleted. 
-My partner and I both had backup files in case it happens again.
-For a while things were going slowly since the CSV files were taking a while to be prepared and they were needed to test the methods in order to proceed.
-We used temperary numbers and methods to test existing methods and changed the methods to match the new CSV files later.

Unresolved Issues
-We might not be able to do everything we wanted since there isn't enough time.

Cool Stuff Learned (conceptual and/or practical)
-How to use CSV files in Java

Mid-development Design Changes (and why!)
-Might have to decrease the maps/gym leaders/ quests since we don't have as much time as we would like

Lessons Learned (...which you might apply to future projects, CS or otherwise)
-Always communicate with your partner to make sure when needs to be done and confirm if there are any changes in existing files
